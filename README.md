# Visualising-the-gender-gap-in-college-degrees-

In this project, I'll focus on how to use data visualization to communicate insights and tell stories. In this project, I'll start with a standard matplotlib plot and improve its appearance to better communicate the patterns i want a viewer to understand. Along the way, I'll introduce the principles that informed those changes and provide a framework for you to apply them in the future. Here's a preview that demonstrates some of the improvements we make in this course:

[The Department of Education Statistics releases](https://nces.ed.gov/programs/digest/2013menu_tables.asp) a data set annually containing the percentage of bachelor's degrees granted to women from 1970 to 2012. The data set is broken up into 17 categories of degrees, with each column as a separate category.

Randal Olson, a data scientist at University of Pennsylvania, has cleaned the data set and made it available on his personal website. You can download the dataset Randal compiled [here](http://www.randalolson.com/wp-content/uploads/percent-bachelors-degrees-women-usa.csv). Here's a preview of the first few rows:
